not working is trying with gradient library thats not working
original-original is sth with colors
original it's also with colors
v1 random colors from palette Vibrant
v2 - palette color based on player section (whole player divided to segments)
v3.1 - variables and organization
v3.2 - optimalization and some localstorage and different animation speed etc.
v4 - Async impementation

current one is v2 because i like it
(modified to only show first 2 colors from palette)


UPDATE: For All Versions I changed MutationObserver observing from  [ ".Root__now-playing-bar" ] => [ ".main-nowPlayingWidget-trackInfo" ] 
	because of a bug where you paused or did any action on playbar, it would trigger applyGradientFromCoverArt() which always sets gradient color to first color.

new current one is v2 but with SECTIONS_COUNT variable and smart Math.Min function to prevent going outside the palette.

const section = Math.floor(progressFraction * SECTIONS_COUNT); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and
const paletteKey = paletteKeys[section % Math.min(6, SECTIONS_COUNT)];

new current one is v2 + v4 (animation length)
